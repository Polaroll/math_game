# Overview

This program is a simple math game for grade school. The website generates random math equations and has the user try to solve them. Correct answers are recorded in the score while incorrect answers have the user retry the question.


# Development Environment

We used JavaScript and HTML by first creating a simple website to hold our game, then using JavaScript to run the logic of the game and update the HTML, making an interactive webpage. GitHub was used to work on the program in separate branches for ease of use and to simplify combining our code.

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

# Future Work

* Add consequences, such as a timer or ending the game on too many wrong answers
* Make the website look nicer through style changes
* Add custom difficulty settings
* Add more types of math equations that can generate
* Allow for complex equation generation (equations with more than 2 values or multiple operator types)
* Add a leaderboard system
